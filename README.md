# alertmanager-githubfiles-receiver

An Alertmanager webhook receiver which creates files in a GitHub repository based on the received alert(s), e.g., when using cstate/cstate Status page.

## Status

This project is work in progress (Alpha level).

## TODO

- [ ] Find a way to find "old" incidents (e.g., incident starts on 14. July and goes till 20. July). Ideas:
  * How about using the calendar week?
  * Iterating over X older files for the same service?
